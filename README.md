Lab   1 RISC-V Assembly Instructions
Purpose
This lab is intended to help you have a better understanding of   the RISC-V   assembly   instructions, and get familiarized with Ripes which is a visual   computer   architecture   simulator   and assembler built for the RISC-V instruction set architecture.
Tasks
1.       Read Ripes Introduction   at   https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes/blob/master/docs/introduction.md   to   learn   about   the software. Learn more information about Ripes at the wiki page.   Everything else   about   the   software   can   be   found   at   https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes.
2.       Download and install Ripes simulator on your computer. You   can   find   the   latest   release that suits your operating system on   your   computer   at   https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes/releases.   Play with the software and get familiarized   with the software environment.
3.       Learn   RISC-V   assembly   syntax   at 代 写ECE3700J Introduction to Computer Organization Lab 1 RISC-V Assembly InstructionsPython
代做程序编程语言  https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-asm-manual/blob/master/riscv-asm.md.   In the software, load example assembly files   and   learn   from the example   code.
4.       Write a short assembly program. Create a   string   of   characters   of   your   choice   in   the    .data   segment of   memory using    .string   directive. Then copy the string to a   different memory   section starting at address 0x10000100. Click the   Select Processor button   on the upper   left corner, and select 32-bit   Single-cycle processor to debug your program.
Deliverables
This is a   1-week lab. This lab is not   counted towards the   lab   grade.
1)         Demonstrate your program to the TAs before your lab session ends. Go through the   program step by step and show corresponding   changes   in   the registers   and   memory.
2)       Upload the   source   file(s) on   Canvas by   22:00   pm,   May   25,   2024.
This is an individual assignment. Your work must be submitted electronically   to   Canvas   before the specified   due   date.
